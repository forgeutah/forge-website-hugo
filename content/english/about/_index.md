#### Why Forge Exists

Back in 2013 I loved seeing Beehive Startups and Silicon Slopes (now combined) emerge to organize Utah's local 
tech community. Silicon Slopes is still an amazing org and I love reading their content and following what is 
going on with local businesses. But it seems like the focus is on CEOs, fundraising, and other business specific topics. As a programmer myself, I wanted a community for the engineers, developers, data scientist, etc. who were building the technology companies in Utah. I wanted a community for the actual technologists.

So in 2015 Forge Utah Foundation was born to fill that need. We are an official 501(c)(3) not for profit company.

#### Our Mission
The Foundation's mission is help grow technology education and talent in Utah by sharing, learning, and building.

##### Share

First and foremost we believe in sharing information. Our goal is to facilitate sharing as a form of “enlightened self interest” (sharing freely for karma). We also believe strongly in open source and want to share as much code, configs, and general information as possible.

##### Learn

The Foundation is a place to learn, mainly from content shared by others, but also we plan to host workshops and facilitate learning of all kinds in the local community.

##### Build

The culmination of all the sharing and learning is ultimately to build. We want to empower our community to build the next generation of technology.
