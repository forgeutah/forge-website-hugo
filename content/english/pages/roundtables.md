#### Roundtables

Forge roundtables are small groups (typically no more than 10 people) that get together at least quarterly and talk about technology related issues and solicit and give advice. We have two pilots currently:

* Engineering Leadership Roundtable - [See the propsoal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhLFW1m-mKo8NAv_pNSeSwQ0X5l1KytaXW45FKDJ46g/edit?usp=sharing) - Contact clint@theforge.tech to learn more
* Architecture Topics - Monthly meetup at lunch time where anyone can propose topics and we use [dot-voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting) to decide what to discuss that day - Contact @nick on slack to find out more.
